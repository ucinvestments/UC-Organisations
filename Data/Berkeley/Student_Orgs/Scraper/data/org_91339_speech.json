  "description": "\u003cp\u003eSpeech at Berkeley, formerly a part of Speech and Debate at Berkeley, now utilizes only the \"speech\" aspect of \"speech and debate.\" We are a student-run, peer-coached team of speech enthusisasts committed to bettering ourselves through competition in collegiate speech events. We offer members the opportunity to perform \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/afanietnew2/products-services/event-descriptions\"\u003e all 11 AFA-sponsored events\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;competitively at local and national tournaments. We meet weekly to construct and practice our speeches (including those with limited preparation) and attend multiple tournaments throughout the academic year, including the prestigious American Forensics Association's National Individual Events Tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no auditions to be on our team--all that is required to join is enthusiasm to learn the practical skills that come with learning how to perform in a speech event. We are an awesome, strong, competitive team, consistently taking home individual and team sweepstakes awards at tournaments. As we do\u0026nbsp;have limited resources and this activity is a big time commitment, we ask that our members show their own dedication, diligence, and discipline. If you have what it takes, you will find this activity\u0026nbsp;incredibly rewarding. As one Speech at Berkeley member said, \"Getting good at speech is basically cheating for school, in that it prepares you to think really critically, really well, really fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eStudents can join the discord at\u0026nbsp;https://discord.gg/Q9DEWHRfuB for more information.\u003c/p\u003e",
