ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShaping Debate\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThe American Constitution Society brings together many of the country\u0026rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates \u0026ldquo;intellectual capital\u0026rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as \u0026ldquo;originalism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;strict construction\u0026rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuilding Networks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society\u0026rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine that drives the organization\u0026rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking a Difference\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;The strength of ACS\u0026rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken\u0026rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that \u0026ldquo;Originalism isn\u0026rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it\u0026rsquo;s a talking point;\u0026rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.\u003c/p\u003e",
