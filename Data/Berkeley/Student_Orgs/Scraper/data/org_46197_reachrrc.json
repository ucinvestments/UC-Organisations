  "description": "\u003cp\u003eIn 1994, the Retention and Empowerment of Asian/Asian American Youths Considering Higher Education (REACH!) began with a handful of committed folks, as a program under the Asian Student Union (ASU) at UC Berkeley to target \u0026ldquo;Asian American*, high school students, especially those who are underrepresented, low-income, and non-college tracked\u0026rdquo;. Its goals were two-fold: 1) promoting higher education as an attainable goal and 2) empowering students through \u0026ldquo;building ethnic pride and programs that foster community activism and support APA* youth culture\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs REACH! grew organizationally, the vision and purpose of REACH! grew with it. While the mission remained, \u0026ldquo;the service and empowerment of recent immigrant and urban Asian Americans living in at-risk life situations,\u0026rdquo; we added on that \u0026ldquo;Our goal is to promote higher education as a means to empower ourselves and improve the economic and social conditions facing our communities.\u0026rdquo; We saw that REACH! had a unique role on campus and in the A/AA community at large, because REACH! was not just going to increase the numbers of underrepresented Asians at Berkeley but REACH! would be a training ground for future educators, activists, and leaders who would address society\u0026rsquo;s injustices through their life\u0026rsquo;s work. Thus, we created programs to raise political awareness, build coalitions, develop youth leaders, and build leadership in ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eEach year, programs have been refined and recreated by (insanely) dedicated and intelligent coordinators, who look for a better way to do things. However, our single most important legacy is the steady stream of community leaders we have and will produce.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e*As of May 1st, 2022, we have redirected our efforts from serving API communities to fully serve the Asian/Asian American communities.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis group [REACH!
