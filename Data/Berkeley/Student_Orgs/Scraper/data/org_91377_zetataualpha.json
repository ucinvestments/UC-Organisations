At ZTA, we are passionate about empowering each and every sister to reach her full potential, both at this university and beyond. One of the lines in our creed is \"\u003cem\u003eto realize that within our grasp lies the opportunity to learn those things which will ever enrich and ennoble our lives\u003c/em\u003e.\" Our sisters live this out each and every day; we are passionate about our philanthropy, Breast Cancer Education and Awareness, which our chapter recently received a\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eFounders Award\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;for raising $10,000+ in the last 3 years! Our partnerships with Bright Pink and the American Cancer Society have also led us to pass out thousands of pink ribbons at the Think Pink Cal Football Game, volunteer at the survivor booth for \u003cem\u003eMaking Strides\u003c/em\u003e, and put on exciting events for the Greek community such as Sugarfest and Cookout for a Cure.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Even more, we maintain a sisterhood that lasts a lifetime; Zetas can be found in so many organizations, be it dance, pre-professional organizations, consulting, STEM labs, or even the ASUC! The friendships formed at ZTA will follow you through your entire collegiate experience, from football gamedays with your sisters to weekends in San Fransisco or Lake Tahoe. The mentorship from older members, both in academics and in life, will be invaluable as you navigate a campus of 40,000 students, and will shape the way you see the world around you. ZTA also offers over 30 leadership positions and multiple committees within the chapter, which allow you to develop your strengths and give back!\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Last but not least, you'll always have a home at 2714 Durant Avenue; from Friday brunches to Bachelor Mondays, our sorority is undoubtedly a home away from home :)\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Zeta Tau Alpha participates in Fall Formal Recruitment as well as continuous open bidding (COB) at the beginning of each semester, so if you are interested in joining our organization, visit our website or email our vice president of membership at ztacalmembership@gmail.com.
