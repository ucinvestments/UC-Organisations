  "description": "\u003cp\u003eIndigenous and Native Coalition (INC) Recruitment and Retention Center, formerly known as Native American Recruitment and Retention Center (NARRC), is a student-initiated organization consisting of university faculty, staff, and undergraduate students who recognize the significance of keeping higher education accessible and attainable for Native Americans, Indigenous people, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders. We recognize the complexities of Native and Indigenous histories and identities and work to convey this to the larger campus community. INC concentrates its recruitment efforts on diverse Native and Indigenous communities, encouraging Native Americans, Indigenous, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders of all ages to apply and attend various forms of post-secondary education. We seek to increase Native and Indigenous presence at all levels of higher education, including but not limited to, community colleges, tribal colleges, four-year institutions, and technical schools. We promote community involvement beyond campus borders by hosting collaborative events with organizations such as the Native American Health Center, Intertribal Friendship House, and the American Indian Child Resource Center.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eINC works to create and to provide a variety of support programs and resources for Native American, Indigenous, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students at UC Berkeley in order to help them succeed and ultimately graduate. Our organization aims to establish a support system at Cal by providing safe spaces on campus as well as collaborating with other on-campus organizations. INC-RRC plays a key role in helping students balance individual success at Cal while maintaining pride in their heritage(s). Members of INC set an example for younger Native and Indigenous students, demonstrating that they can get here and also be successful in this competitive environment. It is our purpose to keep Native and Indigenous students at Cal and to increase and maintain adequate retention within the University. We must provide students with the necessary resources to achieve and foster a sense of community amongst our members.\u003c/p\u003e",
