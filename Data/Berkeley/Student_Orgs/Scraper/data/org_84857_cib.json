  "description": "\u003cp\u003eFounded in 2012 and reincorporated in 2014, Capital Investments at Berkeley was created by and for students striving to obtain real trading experience and provide investors superior risk-adjusted returns. In a perpetually changing market environment, CIB prides itself in our creative approach to trading, implementing a wide variety of strategies using a large selection of financial instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur investment philosophy is founded on the belief that capital preservation is more important than capital gains and in the long run a dynamic asset allocation and reactivity to market inefficiencies can generate above market returns. Further, we believe that as students, we have a unique perspective and differentiated views on markets, economies, and current events which provide rare opportunities for investors. Finally, we believe that as stewards of capital we have a deep responsibility to consider all stakeholders affected by our decisions, including our investors, employees of publicly traded companies, our communities, disadvantaged groups, the environment, and more. Only through active management and dedicated equity research can these responsibilities be fully materialized in investing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur team leverages the unique skill-sets of our members and their varied academic and vocational backgrounds to deliver these returns to our partners. CIB draws on the combined experience of our members as employees of investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, federal regulatory agencies, technology companies, legal firms, and start-ups notably including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lazard, BlackRock, Blackstone, Centerview Partners, IMC, JMP Securities, the Federal Reserve, Dodge and Cox, Point72, Bain \u0026amp; Co., Vista Equity Partners, and Google.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur culture is data and performance driven; we combine the financial acumen of our veteran members with the entrepreneurial philosophy of our school to create dynamism within existing investment structures. This creativity and unique synthesis of information is the cornerstone of CIB\u0026rsquo;s idea generation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur portfolio utilizes hedging strategies and a \u0026ldquo;risk-management first\u0026rdquo; approach to realize consistent returns that outperform the market. Trades are made through quantitative evaluation of a risk-reward profile and the ever-changing market environment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCapital Investments at Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s long term goals include achieving capital preservation and gains regardless of market conditions, maintaining our loyal investor base, continuing to leverage our extensive alumni network, and providing students interested in finance and investment management real world opportunities to create value and preparation for careers.\u003c/p\u003e",
