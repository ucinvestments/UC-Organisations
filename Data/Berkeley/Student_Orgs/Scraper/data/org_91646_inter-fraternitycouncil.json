  "description": "\u003cp\u003eThe Interfraternity Council (IFC) is one of four Greek councils at Cal that abide by the pillars of Friendship, Leadership, Scholarship and Service. We are the binding organization that ties all of the recognized fraternity chapters on campus. The number of fraternities is now over thrity, which amounts to approximately 1300 of the undergradute men at UC Berkeley. IFC serves chiefly as the official connection between the individual chapters and the University of California. As a council we are by and large self-governed through the efforts of representative delegates from each chapter, who work year long with the officers on IFC to strategize, plan, organize and execute short and long term goals to ensure the growth of the fraternity system at Cal.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIFC can also be thought of as the organization capable of doing things for the benefit of the entire community that no individual chapter has the resources to do on their own. We frequently engage in activities that include Greek-wide philanthropy and social events, public relations with the University and rest of the Berkeley community, risk management and safety of the entire community and Greek wide recruitment, to name a few.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRecruitment into IFC chapters is generally available at the beginning of every semester to every undergraduate male seeking to enhance their time at Cal by being a part of an organization that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Greek members graduate with uncomparable experiences of the brotherhood, leadership opportunities and social life that is inherent in every chapter, regardless of the letters.\u003c/p\u003e",
  "summary": "The Inter-Fraternity Council represents over thirty Greek organizations on Berkeley's campus. The Council aims to ensure that its members get the most out of their time at Cal by emphasizing four pillarsâ€”Leadership, Friendship, Scholarship and Service.",
