This class is built for students who do not have any prior experience or knowledge of these programs.\u0026nbsp;We work with students in developing a thorough understanding of these programs with weekly lessons and hands-on tutorials. In addition, students complete relevant homework exercises which aim to give students the opportunity to practice tools, develop original designs, and channel their creativity.

We start off with the basics (camera manipulations and shooting in RAW) and quickly move onto composition rules and tricks to get better, more thought out photos, and from there move onto how to be a professional photographer, photo ethics, and integrating art into photography. By the end, students will feel strong in their photographic abilities, be able to critique their own work, and see the world through an artistic eye, so they can further grow as a photographer.\u0026nbsp;It is intended to be for beginners with little to no knowledge of how to use a dSLR or other camera with manual capabilities.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ol\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the year, Innovative Design hosts a variety of events, from our annual designathon CMYK: Come Make Your MarK, speaker and workshop series RGB: Reach / Grow / Build, and an educational weekend series of creative workshops HEX: Hone and EXplore.
