  "description": "\u003cp\u003eLaw schools and the legal profession are currently strongly dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology, which advocates a centralized and uniform society. While some members of the academic community have dissented from these views, by and large they are taught simultaneously with (and indeed as if they were) the law.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order. It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be. The society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Berkeley Law chapter of the Federalist Society\u0026rsquo;s goals include: promoting thoughtful and challenging discussion of legal and public policy issues; academically and intellectually sponsoring conservative and libertarian law students; and ensuring that Berkeley Law\u0026nbsp;students are thoughtfully exposed to conservative and libertarian perspectives and consider these perspectives in their analysis of legal issues. We put on a number of great events, which include bringing out leading judges, legal scholars, and practicing lawyers to address hot-button issues of importance to the Federalist Society. We are also a social club, with happy hours and some planned excursions in the mix.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMembership is open to all students who are interested in thoughtful debate and the exchange of ideas, regardless of political ideology.\u003c/p\u003e",
