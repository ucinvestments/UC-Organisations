On this campus\u0026mdash;where 42% of students\u0026nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008\u0026mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this\u0026nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBesides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories \u0026amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop\u0026nbsp;as a student organization. We are open \u003cstrong\u003eto all students\u003c/strong\u003e interested in community health and specifically the AAPI community. We hope that through\u0026nbsp;this organization, we foster in students a desire to serve the community as well as provide opportunities for leadership development and networking.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe invite your participation in AAPIHRG as a student or as a health professional sharing the following vision and mission:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVISION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA healthy community can only exist within a healthy society.
