  "description": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eHistorically, venture capital is a male-dominated field, lacking diversity on the investment team. Women account for only 9% of venture capitalists, 8% of firm partners, and 7% of board seats. This not only negatively affects women interested in the field, but also companies and entrepreneurs. Many women are not taught about venture capital, think joining the field is an unattainable goal, and are discouraged from joining clubs or startups because of their gender. As a result, women are not being invested in because women are not making these decisions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eGirls Into VC at Berkeley is dedicated to increasing the number of women in venture capital.

We also have designed, launched, and manage multiple programs, including the Mentorship Program where applicants are paired with women in established funds, Externship Program where members work with startups on substantial 8-week projects, Scout Program where members meet with women-led startups and share their memos with our network VCs, and Fellowship Program where accepted students take part in a 10-week comprehensive introduction to VC. We also established the Girls Into VC Summit, bringing together 250 members for panels, workshops, and a pitch competition. Girls Into VC has been highlighted in several media outlets including Forbes 30 Under 30. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
