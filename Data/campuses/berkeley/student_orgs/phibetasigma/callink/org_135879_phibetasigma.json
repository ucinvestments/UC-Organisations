  "description": "\u003cp\u003ePhi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as \u0026ldquo;a part of\u0026rdquo; the general community rather than \u0026ldquo;apart from\u0026rdquo; the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence\u0026hellip;without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the \u0026ldquo;inclusive we\u0026rdquo; rather than the \u0026ldquo;exclusive we\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFrom its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity\u0026rsquo;s motto, \u0026ldquo;Culture For Service and Service For Humanity.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe fraternity exceeded the prevailing models of Black Greek-Letter fraternal organizations by being the first to establish alumni chapters, to establish youth mentoring clubs, to establish a federal credit union, to establish chapters in Africa, and establish a collegiate chapter outside of the United States, and is the only fraternity to hold a constitutional bond with a predominantly African-American sorority, Zeta Phi Beta (\u0026Zeta;\u0026Phi;\u0026Beta;), which was founded on January 16, 1920, at Howard University in Washington, D.C., through the efforts of members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Outta Pocket Omicron Psi Chapter was chartered on January 25, 1985 on the campus of the University of California Berkeley by 7 men: Anthony Sykes, James Jackson, Marvin Gibson, Earl Watson, Norman Dawkins, Booker Crisp, Cedric Nellum.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
