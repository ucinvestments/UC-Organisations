Sigma Chi best serves this purpose by developing, implementing and monitoring programs that foster leadership, build character and promote positive relationship skills that, in turn, enable our members to become productive and caring participants\r\n in their families, colleges and communities.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, Sigma Chi offers a host of social life rewards, but it does so in the context of molding good character within its members. Integrity, sound judgment and loyalty are all lofty goals that can occasionally be found contradictory to the impulses of\r\n collegiate life. Our fraternity provides a medium for character development that assists young men in developing the qualities of their character. Our direct input in developing American leaders is so thorough that on June 13, 2005, Sigma Chi was the first\r\n Greek-letter society to be honored by the United States Congress for the fraternity's 150th anniversary.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Alpha Beta Chapter here at the University of California, Berkeley was the first Sigma Chi chapter to be founded on the West Coast. Started in 1886 with the help of former Confederate General Harry St. John Dixon, our fraternity expanded to all corners\r\n of the United States. In 1913, the fraternity moved into its current location on the corner of College and Channing. The house is a block away from the biggest dining hall at Cal, Crossroads, and only two blocks away from campus. Currently, our chapter consists\r\n of 50 members, 22 of which live in.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n",
