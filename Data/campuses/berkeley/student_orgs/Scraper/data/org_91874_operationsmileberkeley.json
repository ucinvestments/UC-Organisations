  "description": "\u003cp\u003eEvery three minutes a child is born with a cleft, and chances are that one in ten of those children will not be able to see their first birthday. Even if these children survive, they will have to face constant battles with social stigma,\u0026nbsp;malnourishment, and speech impediments. But each child deserves\u0026nbsp;to have\u0026nbsp;another chance, to\u0026nbsp;have access to the\u0026nbsp;safe, proper medical care that could help alleviate\u0026nbsp;some of the challenges they face as a result of their condition.\u0026nbsp;This is what Operation Smile is all about. Here\u0026nbsp;at Berkeley, we are determined to make an impact in not only our community by raising awareness, but also globally by raising funds to help children\u0026nbsp;be able to\u0026nbsp;reveal their smile for the very first time in their lives.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOperation Smile has approved the Operation Smile at Berkeley Volunteer Program! Our club members will become Volunteer Program Leaders, guiding middle and high school students to create blankets for surgery patients and cards of emotional support for Operation Smile's surgeons, nurses, and social workers the mission trips.

Together, we will make the world smile.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis group [Operation Smile at Berkeley] was formerly named [Operation Smile] - [9/23/21] IZ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
