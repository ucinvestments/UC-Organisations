  "description": "\u003cp\u003eSigma Mu Delta is a premedical/pre-health fraternity which promotes the advancement of premedical students through three principles deeply valued by our brothers: brotherhood, education and dedication. It is through these pillars that the fraternity members work together towards obtaining the primary goal of admission into medical school, while simultaneously helping to shape the physicians of tomorrow.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSigma Mu Delta fulfills these goals of the premedical student through our rapidly growing alumni network, rich peer advising, and supportive brotherhood. We help our brothers achieve their true potential during their undergraduate years at University of California \u0026ndash; Berkeley with resources ranging from our exclusive test bank to our partnership with The Princeton Review. In the past few years, our brothers have gone on to top-tier medical schools including Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, UCSF Medical School, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur members help the community through service events for organizations such as the American Cancer Society\u0026rsquo;s Relay for Life, Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Center, and Glide Memorial Church.
