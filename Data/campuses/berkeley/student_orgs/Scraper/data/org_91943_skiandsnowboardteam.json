  "description": "\u003cp\u003eThe Ski and Snowboard Team at Berkeley is a group of skiers and snowboarders from the University of California, Berkeley.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe compete in the NorCal conference of USCSA (United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association) against Stanford, UC Davis, University of Nevada, and Sierra Nevada College among others. We have both men's and women's teams in Alpine ski and snowboard racing, ski and snowboard Freestyle, and Skier-X and Boarder-X. We have sent individual competitors and teams to USCSA Nationals competitions around the country.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not require potential members to try out or have prior competitive experience--instead, potential members should be skiers or snowboarders who are passionate about their sport and enjoy spending time in the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe hire expert ski and snowboard coaches every season and everyone improves tremendously. Competition and training is a large part of what we do, but there is plenty of time for freeskiing and earning gnar points.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe get season passes every year; for 2025-26 we will be getting a discounted Ikon pass in order to ski primarily at Palisades Tahoe/Alpine Meadows. Many members travel to Tahoe each weekend during the ski season, so getting up to the mountains is very accessible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Fall we prepare for the season with optional dryland workouts and social events to get to know everybody on the team and stay in shape during the off-season. During the last two weeks of winter break, we will all live in Tahoe and ski early every day and have the times of our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCal Ski Team #1. Keeping Tahoe Blue and Gold.\u003c/p\u003e",
