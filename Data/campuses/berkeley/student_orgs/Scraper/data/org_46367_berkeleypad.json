  "description": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePhi Alpha Delta is UC Berkeley's oldest and largest pre-law fraternity, providing its membership with unrivaled leadership experience, tailored professional development, and access to an accomplished alumni network. Involvement in PAD is enriching, not only in terms of professionalism, but also in terms of personal development. As we explore the legal field and take important steps towards law school admission, we learn to work successfully alongside one another, developing broad interpersonal skills, tolerance, and mutual respect for our brothers and sisters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCultivating Professionalism\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOur fraternity wants to do more than simply create a space where students interested in the law can come together. We want to provide our members with the skills and knowledge to go on to law school, careers in the legal field, and any other professional aspiration they may have. Through our Membership Development program, our professional events, and our many networking opportunities, members will find themselves graduating with a plethora of tools for their futures.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInvesting Service\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLaw is not a field solely aimed at making money and gaining influence. Members of PAD find that we put just as much emphasis on the fairness and equity of law. To that end, our members take the skills they've acquired at Berkeley and in our fraternity to help the wider community and make a positive impact in the lives of others. Our Philanthropy committee makes it a point to provide accessible opportunities to reinvest time into making a difference.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePromoting Fraternalism\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePAD may be a place to hone your skills for the future, but ask any member and they will say that one of the most important pieces of PAD for them is the community. By creating an environment where new and old members can get to know each other and form lasting friendships and meaningful connections, our fraternity ensures that, by joining, you become a part of the biggest family at Cal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEncouraging Leadership\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe take pride in giving members the tools they need to become leaders in the fraternity, on campus, and beyond. After the completion of Membership Development, new members have the opportunity to become more involved by applying to committee directorships. Others take the skills they've learned to become active in other organizations. We've had PAD members take leadership roles in the ASUC, Daily Californian, Undergraduate Political Science Association, Berkeley Project, and many many more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/448726633\"\u003eRecruitment Video\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
