Members of ToxSA will also become members of the NorCal Society of Toxicology (SOT) and be Undergraduate Affiliates with the SOT. This will give students the opportunity to interact with real life toxicologists and access scholarship and other career opportunities. Past events have included a career fair with a variety of professional toxicologists from biotechnology companies, state departments, academia, consulting, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"\u003eCommunity Service/Projects\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"\u003eIn the past, ToxSA sponsored the Lead Education Awareness Program (LEAP) which spread awareness about household hazards and air pollution, and has also worked with the NorCal Society of Toxicology and the Lawrence Hall of Science to encourage and introduce students to toxicology through a variety of events and services. Members will have the opportunity to join projects and work on collaborations like these in the future. Additionally, members will have the opportunity to participate in monthly Journal Clubs where students will present and discuss relevant research studies with other members of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_p2\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"\u003eCommunity\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"\u003eOur goal is to create a supportive and inclusive space for students curious about toxicology to explore and develop their interests with others. Beyond just academic and professional pursuits, we also hope to encourage personal growth and a positive environment. From study groups and resource sharing to social events, ToxSA supports students not only through their years at Berkeley, but also helps them for the future by exploring careers and networking while being a part of a growing community of toxicologists!\u003c/p\u003e",
