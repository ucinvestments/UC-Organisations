  "description": "\u003cp\u003eThe idea and first versions of CaHPSA, active under several different names, started around 2005 as a loose association of campus level leaders who had a passion for health reform and primarily organized around Lobby Day each year. Parker Duncan, the first Medical Student Fellow, was extremely involved in the development of the student leaders during these years.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, involved campus student leaders, along with the statewide Lobby Day team, held their first student leadership meeting to brainstorm ways to structure the organization for the future. There was a general consensus that additional organization at the state level could be a useful tool for CaHPSA. The mission statement was developed from a rougher draft of the previous year. The core functions of the organization were agreed upon to be \"Educate \u0026ndash; Advocate \u0026ndash; Grow\" and statewide positions were developed from these core functions.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCaHPSA at Berkeley too aligns with the belief \"health justice for all\" and endeavors to carrying the following goals:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eSupport efforts to improve quality of and access to health care in California\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eProvide opportunities for students to develop health advocacy and communication skills\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eEducate and train future health and medical professionals to become effective health advocates\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eEngender a sense of social responsibility among students\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eAdvocate for a single-payer health system\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe offer programs such as Project White Coat to certify students in helping more people enroll in health insurance and prepare for the annual Lobby Day which occurs in Sacramento.
