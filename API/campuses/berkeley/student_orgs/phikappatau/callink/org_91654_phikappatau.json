Since then, 146 chapters have been chartered and over 100,000 men have been initiated into our brotherhood.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePhilanthropy:\u003cbr /\u003eThe brothers of Phi Kappa Tau work every semester to raise money for the SeriousFun Children\u0026rsquo;s Network (formerly known as Hole in the Wall Camps). This organization was founded in 1988 by Phi Tau alumnus Paul Newman. The money we raise helps facilitate camps in 31 countries for children with life-threatening illnesses. Over 100,000 children have attended these camps free of charge as a result of Phi Tau\u0026rsquo;s national efforts.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLeaders on Campus:\u003cbr /\u003eMembers of Phi Kappa Tau at Berkeley have prominent roles in Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s Model United Nations, campus administration, and intramural sports. Brothers of Phi Tau also take part in club sports, boxing, and the Interfraternity Council.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMore than just a four year Experience:\u003cbr /\u003eMembership in Phi Kappa Tau not only enhances each brother\u0026rsquo;s college experience, but provides opportunities to enrich one\u0026rsquo;s life after graduation. Our alumni network flourishes from coast to coast, even showing a presence internationally. Graduates often find work after college as a result of recommendations from other Phi Tau alumni. Moreover, the friendships created within our fraternity last decades longer than the time spent in school.\u003c/p\u003e",
