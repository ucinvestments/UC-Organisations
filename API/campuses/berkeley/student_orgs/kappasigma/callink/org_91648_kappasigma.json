We have multiple officeholders, such as senators, governors, and even a presidential candidate. Many Kappa Sigma alumni are professional musicians, actors, and performers. We also have many alumni who are pro athletes across many sports. Kappa Sigma has even been to the moon! Edgar Mitchell was a part of the Apollo 14 mission and was the sixth person to walk on the moon.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eKappa Sigma is returning this Fall of 2025 and are looking for any interested outstanding men to come out to rush. The Beta Xi chapter of Kappa Sigma rechartered in Spring 2024 and is now reinstated in Spring 2025. We currently have a group of 30+ guys consisting of many different years and majors. Many of our brothers are interested in a variety of activities such as weight lifting, barbecuing, sports, climbing, hiking, and more!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAs we are a new fraternity, we are looking to start new traditions and events here at Cal and we want to branch out into all aspects of student life such as philanthropy, sports, and academics. We want to contend in competitive intramural teams like soccer, football, and basketball. We also have a full year of fun brotherhood events like retreats, road trips, barbecues, and date parties!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you are interested in meeting the brothers and becoming a part of an amazing community then come on out to our Rush events (@calkappasigma), meet the brothers and learn about what it means to be a brother of Kappa Sigma.
